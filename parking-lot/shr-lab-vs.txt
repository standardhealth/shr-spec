Description:        "Values that determine how the data in a particular column of the variant file should be applied."
#fixed-value        "Check if the value in the target field is equal to the given value or one of the given values."
#vs-required      "Check if the value in the target field comes from the given value set. This test should file if the value in the instance is not found in the value set."
#vs-extensible    "Check if the value in the target field comes from the given value set. This test should pass unless it can be determined the value in the instance does not come from the value set yet is synonomous with one of the codes in the value set."
#vs-preferred    "Check the value in the target field and determine if it comes from the given value set. As a preferred binding, this test always passes."
#lower-cardinality  "Check the cardinality of the target field for conformance with the lower cardinality."
#upper-cardinality  "Check the cardinality of the target field for conformance with the lower cardinality."
#data-type  "Check the data type of the target field. This test passes if the data type in the instance corresponds to the given data type(s). This check is in addition to the data type constraint in the base resource or profile. An example where data-type can be used is when an Observation.value[x] field should be further restricted."
#lower-bound  "Check if the value in the target field is greater than or equal to the given value."
#upper-bound  "Check if the value in the target field is less than or equal to the given value."
