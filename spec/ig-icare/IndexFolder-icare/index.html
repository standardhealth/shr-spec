<h1>About the ICAREdata&reg; Project</h1>

<p>The overall goal of the <a href="http://icaredata.org/" target="_blank">ICAREdata&reg; project</a> is to support the prospective collection of high quality real-world data, based on <a href="http://mcodeinitiative.org" target="_blank">mCODE&trade;</a>, to enable clinical oncology research.</p>

<p>The Integrating Clinical trials And Real-world Endpoints data (ICAREdata&reg;) project is a collaboration between The MITRE Corporation, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The project is conducting a study to demonstrate the ability to use high-quality mCODE-based real-world data in a clinical trial setting.</p>

<h1>ICAREdata&reg; and mCODE&trade;</h1>

<p>This implementation guide intends to cover content necessary for ICAREdata&reg; that is not part of the <a href="http://fhir.hl7.org/us/mcode" target="_blank">mCODE&trade; specification</a>. Implementers should refer directly to mCODE&trade; for the specification of all mCODE&trade; elements.</p>
<p>The mCODE&trade; implementation guide includes information on how to interpret conformance requirements as well as elements marked as "must support". This implementation guide follows those same guidelines.</p>

<h1>Structured phrases, mCODE&trade; and the ICAREData&reg; IG</h1>

<p>The ICAREdata&reg strategy is to collect improved real-world data in a way does not disrupt existing clinical processes and minimizes burden to the provider while enabling the collection of complete, accurate, and computable data. ICAREdata&reg; questions are answered by clinicians with the results appearing as structured (#hashtag) phrases in the clinical note.</p>

<p>ICAREdata&reg; structured phrases questions and value sets are intended to be mapped to FHIR resources compliant with the requirements specified in the mCODE&trade; and ICAREdata&reg; implementation guides. This includes mapping 1) the ICAREdata&reg; question to the appropriate FHIR resource and element, and 2) the associated value to the appropriate vocabulary defined in the specification.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates how ICAREdata&reg; structured phrases relate to FHIR profiles and implementation guides.</p>

<h1>Known Issues and Limitations</h1>
<p>The profiles in this implementation guide may have dependencies on content in other implementation guides, namely mCODE&trade;. These dependencies may not always resolve in the profile.</p>
