<h1>About the iCAREData&trade; Project</h1>
<p>The overall goal of the <a href="http://icaredata.org/" target="_blank">ICAREdata&trade; project</a> is to enable clinical oncology research by prospectively gathering high quality real-world data.</p>
<p>The ICAREdata&trade; project is a collaboration between MITRE, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The project is conducting a study in association with a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which aims to demonstrate the ability to calculate equivalent clinical trial endpoints using computable clinical treatment data.</p>
<p>As part of the study, an open source infrastructure and data-capture methodology are being developed and piloted to capture higher quality EHR-based treatment data, and permit the assessment of 1:1 correlation between RCT and real-world data.</p>
