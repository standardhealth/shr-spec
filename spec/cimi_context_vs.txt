ValueSet: 					ExceptionValueVS
Description:				"Reasons that a value associated with a test or other finding is missing. Includes all codes from 	http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason version 3.3.0 and additional codes covering other missing value circumstances."
#unknown					"Unknown: The value is not known."
#asked-unknown				"Asked But Unknown: The source human does not know the value."
#temp-unknown				"Temporarily Unknown: There is reason to expect (from the workflow) that the value may become known."
#not-asked					"Not Asked: The workflow didn't lead to this value being known."
#asked-declined				"Asked But Declined: The source was asked but declined to answer."
#masked						"Masked: The information is not available due to security, privacy or related reasons."
#not-applicable				"Not Applicable: There is no proper value for this element (e.g. last menstrual period for a male)"
#unsupported				"Unsupported: The source system wasn't capable of supporting this element."
#as-text					"As Text: The content of the data is represented in the resource narrative."
#error						"Error: Some system or workflow process error means that the information is not available."
#not-a-number				"Not a Number (NaN): The numeric value is undefined or unrepresentable due to a floating point processing error."
#negative-infinity			"Negative Infinity (NINF): The numeric value is excessively low and unrepresentable due to a floating point processing error."
#positive-infinity			"Positive Infinity (PINF): The numeric value is excessively high and unrepresentable due to a floating point processing error."
#not-performed				"Not Performed: The value is not available because the observation procedure  (test, etc.) was not performed."
#not-permitted				"Not Permitted: The value is not permitted in this context (e.g. due to profiles, or the base data types)"
// The following values are extensions to the FHIR values, applicable to lab tests
#missing_indeterminate		"The value cannot be determined, for some unspecified reason."
#missing_noexplanation		"The reason the information is not present is not known."
#missing_nonesuch			"The answer is missing because nothing of a type of thing is known to exists, e.g., the siblings of an only child. Also use this code to represent a 'none of the above' answer"
#missing_collection			"Missing due to a problem collecting, identifying, or locating the specimen, including patient refusal or unable to provide specimen"
#missing_specimen			"Missing due to a problem with the specimen, e.g. inadequate specimen, contamination, clotting, improper tube type, improper storage, too small, etc."
#missing_malfunction		"Missing due to instrument malfunction."
