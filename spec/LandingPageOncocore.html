<p>This is the DRAFT VERSION 0.3 ALPHA of the Minimum Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) implementation guide.</p>
	
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>According to the National Cancer Institute, 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes. In 2014, an estimated 14.7M people were living with cancer in the United States. While numbers for cancer and other major diseases are staggering in terms of human suffering, such large figures also provide a place to look for potential solutions. The ultimate goal is to establish data models, technologies, and methods that result in research-quality real-world EHR data for every patient that drives evidence-based and data-driven treatment and analytics for high-quality health outcomes. The intent is that this research-quality real-world data would allow the information gathered from all cancers patient to contribute substantially to improving care for all future cancer patients.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and in partnership with CancerLinQ and MITRE, a committee of leading clinical experts in oncology is developing mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements). mCODE consists of a core set of structured data elements necessary to support clinical care and oncology research across all cancers.</p>
