Susan: Immunizations--both history per SHR v0.2 and confirmation that ones due during pregnancy are given. TDaP; flu for everyone.  If indicated Hep A, Hep B, meningococcal, pneumococcal. Rhogam at 28 weeks if indicted and other times in pregnancy if indicated.  If patient is not immune needs Varicella and MMR postpartum-----and way to flag that in the SHR with notification triggered by birth.
