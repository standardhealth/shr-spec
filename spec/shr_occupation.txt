		Concept:		LNC#74165-2 "HistoryOfEmploymentStatus"
		Description:	"A person’s current economic relationship to a job, for example, employed (currently working for compensation), unemployed (i.e., searching for work for compensation), or not in the labor force (e.g., student, homemaker, not seeking work).

For example, if the status is 'retired' then the relevant time is the retirement date."
