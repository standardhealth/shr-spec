EntryElement:	HistoryOfEmploymentStatus
Based on:		SimpleCodedNonLaboratoryObservation
Concept:		LNC#74165-2 "HistoryOfEmploymentStatus"
Description:	"A person’s state of being employed during the time period specified. 
Generally, employment status refers to whether or not a person has a job (e.g. employed, unemployed, not in labor force). In a healthcare setting employment status may be used to determine appropriate probing questions for occupational hazards and occupational history. For example, someone who is unemployed or has chosen not to work may be prompted to provide information about previous jobs. Employment status is not the same as work classification, which describes characteristics of a given job such as self-employed."
