		Element:		CurrentEmploymentStatus
		Based on:		CodedEvaluationComponent
		Concept:		LNC#74165-2 "HistoryOfEmploymentStatus"
		Description:	"A person’s current economic relationship to a job, for example, employed (currently working for compensation), unemployed (i.e., searching for work for compensation), or not in the labor force (e.g., student, homemaker, not seeking work). Employment status is not the same as classification of work. The relevant time is when the status was effective (not when the information was gathered). For example, if the status is 'retired' then the relevant time is the retirement date."
