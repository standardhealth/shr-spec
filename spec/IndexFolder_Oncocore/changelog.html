<h2>mCODE 0.9.1 Release</h2>
<p>The following are changes relative to <a href="https://mcodeinitiative.github.io/index.html">mCODE 0.9.0.</a></p>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Updated to FHIR Release 4 from DSTU 2.</li>
    <li>Changed base class of mCODE laboratory panels from Observation to DiagnosticReport.</li>
    <li>Documented mCODE compliance criteria.</li>
    <li>Documented preferred value sets for extensible binding and affect on US Core compliance.</li>
    <li>Changed HistologyMorphologyBehaviorVS value set to descendants of SCT#367651003 (Malignant neoplasm of primary, secondary, or uncertain origin (morphologic abnormality)), from descendants of SCT#108369006 (Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality)), because the latter brought in some concepts that do not represent malignant neoplasms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Updated code systems to new FHIR R4 base URL, http://terminology.hl7.org (previously was http://hl7.org/fhir)</li>
    <li>Changed profile name from GeneticMutationTested to GeneticVariantTested.</li>
    <li>Corrected mapping so the reference to PrimaryCancerCondition in all staging-related observations uses the existing 'focus' attribute.</li>
    <li>Eliminated ClockDirection as a separate value set because values are incorporated in implicitly-defined SNOMED-CT AnatomicalOrientationVS.</li>
    <li>Re-wrote the introductory narratives to consolidate multiple pages.</li>
    <li>Changed clinicalStatus on PrimaryCancerCondition and SecondaryCancerCondition from 1..1 to 0..1</li>

    <li>Eliminated reference range from GeneticVariantTested and components of GeneticVariantFound.</li>
    <li>Improved the definition of "curative" and "palliative" in TreatmentIntentVS.</li>
    <li>Corrected the definition of TreatmentIntent.</li>
    <li>Improved the explanation of the relationships between the genomics-related profiles.</li>

    <li>Updated Data Dictionary to reflect FHIR R4 and other changes above</li>
    <li>Added missing date/time elements to Data Dictionary</li>
    <li>Changed blood pressure test code to LNC#85354-9 "Blood pressure panel with all children optional" to align with FHIR</li>
    <li>Restored device attribute on TumorMarkerTest since laboratories do report it on occasion.</li>
    <li>Added string as an allowable datatype for TumorMarkerTest.value[x], since it is a valid datatype for some of the tests included in TumorMarkerTestVS.</li>
</ul>
