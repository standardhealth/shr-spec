Entry:             CBCWAutoDifferentialPanel
Parent:            HeadlessLaboratoryPanel
Description:       "Complete blood count (CBC) with auto differential panel. Includes various measures of red blood cells, platelets, and various types of white blood cells and other related measures, such as hemoglobin. The components of this panel are not entirely standardized, so the definition of the CBC includes tests that are optional, or performed by certain laboratories but not others. Instances typically will include a subset of the listed panel members. While recognizing scalability limitations, in this case, panel member is described by its own FHIR profile.

Note to FHIR implementers: US-Core v3 states that 'Laboratory results are grouped and summarized using the DiagnosticReport resource which typically reference Observation resource(s). Each Observation resource represents an individual laboratory test or a “nested” panel which references other observations.' Consistent with this guidance, the current profile can be one of the nested Observations within a DiagnosticReport. Alternatively, each sub-Observation in this profile can be added individually to a DiagnosticReport. Both methods are consistent with guidance in US Core v3."
