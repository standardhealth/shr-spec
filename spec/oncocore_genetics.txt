EntryElement:	GenomicsReport
Based on:		DiagnosticReport
Description:	"Genetic analysis summary report. The report may include one or more tests, with two distinct test types. The first type is a targeted mutation test, where a specific mutation on a specific gene is tested for. The result is either positive or negative for that mutation. The second type is a more general test for variants. This type of test returns the identity of variants found in a certain region of the genome. 

The identity of laboratory tests is typically represented by a LOINC code. However, many genetic tests and panels do not have LOINC codes, although some might have an identifier in NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by providers. To identify the diagnostic report, the name of the report must be in the text sub-field of the code structure. If there is a coded identifier from GTR, LOINC, or other source, then it should be included into the the code sub-field of the code structure. If there is no suitable code, the code can be omitted.

The performer of the test (organization or practitioner) should be included in the FHIR profile as the performer.actor.

FHIR implementation note: The category for this profile is set to GE (Genetics), a code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-service-sections. This may be contrary to the Argonaut specification, which assigns the category LAB to any diagnostic report containing a laboratory result."

		Description: "A gene targeted for mutation analysis, identified in HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) notation. The required code is HGNC gene ID. Gene IDs are of the format HGNC:n, where n is a unique number. Only the number, n, should be given as the code. For example, the HGNC identifier for the EGFR gene is 3236. The display text associated with the code should be the HGNC official gene symbol. For example, the official gene symbol for epidermal growth factor receptor is EGFR."

EntryElement:	TumorMarkerTest
Based on:		LaboratoryObservation
Concept:		LNC#21924-6 "Tumor marker Cancer"
Description:	"The result of a tumor marker test. Tumor marker tests are generally used to guide cancer treatment decisions and monitor treatment, as well as to predict the chance of recovery and cancer recurrence. A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis.
