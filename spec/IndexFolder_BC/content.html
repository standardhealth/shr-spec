<h1>Terminology and 3rd Party Content</h1>

<h2><a name="Terminology"></a>Terminology Approach</h2>
<p>The implementation guide supplies terminology bindings drawn primarily from LOINC and SNOMED CT. Laboratory tests are identified by LOINC codes, where available, while coded answers have primarily been drawn from SNOMED CT. An exception to this rule is where LOINC is used to identify a test and LOINC specifies a normative answer list that is not specified in SNOMED CT, in which case, the LOINC normative answer codes were used.</p>
<p>While the AJCC staging system is recognized as one of the most widely-used standards for breast cancer staging, this guide does not include any AJCC terminology due to unresolved copyright issues. As such, <strong>elements related to staging do not currently include required terminology bindings</strong>, and refer back to the staging system used for the appropriate codes. The value sets are known, and their inclusion would considerably strengthen the specification.  Active discussions continue with AJCC to address licensing and fair use with some resolution anticipated in future ballots. In the meantime, supplementary documentation on how the model uses AJCC staging with one example breast cancer patient will be provided outside of the release of this ballot.</p>
<p>Both FHIR and CIMI structurally separates missing value reasons (exception values) from answer sets. For example, FHIR uses two attributes, Observation.value and Observation.dataAbsentReason. For this reason, when LOINC answer lists included missing value explanations, those answers were separated and placed in a separate value set.&nbsp;However, we note that LOINC answer sets are not very consistent with regard to missing value reasons, and possibly incomplete. This leaves open a question on what a cross-cutting normative set of missing value reasons or exception values might be.</p>
<p>Where terminology gaps were identified, requests for terminology additions have been initiated. For the purposes of this IG, gaps have been covered either with local codes, or codes from NCI metathesaurus.</p>
