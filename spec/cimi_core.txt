Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.core
Description:	"The namespace containing definitions for basic classes in CIMI."
Uses:			shr.core, cimi.element, cimi.entity

CodeSystem:		MTH = http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov

Element:		Locatable 
Description:	"Abstract top level class in the CIMI hierarchy. The Locatable class reflects CIMI's implementation using Archetype Description Language (ADL). Its attributes (archetype_node_id, name, and archetype_details) are necessary to serialize CIMI definitions in ADL, but have no clinical relevance. To avoid complicating the profiles with irrelevant extensions, the attributes of Locatable have been omitted."

Element:		Independent
Based on:		Locatable
Description:	"Base class for classes in CIMI that stand alone. Analogous to FHIR's DomainResource."

Element:		NonIndependent   // aka data element
Based on:		Locatable
Description:	"Parent for classes in CIMI that cannot stand alone. These reusable building blocks/data elements can be used to create classes by composition."

Element:		DataType
Based on:		NonIndependent
Description:	"Serves as a common ancestor of all CIMI types which represent the core granularity of the model."

Element:		Content
