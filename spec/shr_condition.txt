Abstract Element:	FindingSiteConditionTopic  
Based on:		ConditionAssertionTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
Description:	"Presence (or absence) of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds.
The FindingSiteCondition topic provides not only the AnatomicalLocation (as in CIMI FindingSiteAssertionTopic), tbut also the type of structure found at that location, such as a wound or tumor."
0..1			FindingSiteIdentifier
1..*			AnatomicalLocation  // inherited attribute, making it required

			Element:	FindingSiteIdentifier
			Concept:	TBD
			Description:	"A human-readable identifier for the condition at the finding site, for example, a wound number or tumor identifier."
			Value:		string

EntryElement:	FindingSiteConditionPresenceStatement
Based on:		ConditionPresenceStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Presence of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. Body structures are continuants that allow observations of the same body structure to be related to be tracked over time."
				StatementTopic is type FindingSiteConditionTopic


EntryElement:	FindingSiteConditionAbsenceStatement  // AssertionOfAbsenceStatement?
Based on:		ConditionAbsenceStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Absence of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. Body structures are continuants that allow observations of the same body structure to be related to be tracked over time."
				StatementTopic is type FindingSiteConditionTopic

EntryElement:	DiseaseProgression
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
Description:	"A finding related to the current trend of a particular existing disease. This concept is most often used for chronic and incurable diseases where the status and trendline of the disease is an important determinant of therapy and prognosis. The specific disorder being evaluated must be cited in the Focus_Reference or Focus_CodeableConcept as a reference to a Condition."
				ObservationContext.ResultValue value is type CodeableConcept
				ObservationContext.ResultValue from ProgressionVS
				ObservationTopic.TopicCode is MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
0..*			ProgressionEvidence
//    "ProgressionEvidence" is somewhat related to FindingMethod, which represents the test or procedure used to generate the result; it is typically a LOINC code (0..1)
//				ObservationTopic.Focus.CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-problem if covered 
0..0			ObservationTopic.Specimen
0..0			ObservationTopic.EvaluationComponent
0..0			ObservationTopic.Precondition
0..0			ObservationTopic.ReferenceRange  // applies to a quantitative measurement only			

		Element:		ProgressionEvidence
		Description:	"The type of evidence considered in determining disease progression."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ProgressionEvidenceVS
