Abstract Element:	BodyStructureTopic
Based on:		ConditionTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
Description:	"Presence (or absence) of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds."
0..1			Identifier
0..1			Morphology
1..*			AnatomicalLocation

	Element:		Morphology
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"The kind of structure being represented. This can define both normal and abnormal morphologies."
	Value:			CodeableConcept

	
EntryElement:	BodyStructurePresenceStatement
Based on:		ConditionPresenceStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Presence of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. Body structures are continuants that allow observations of the same body structure to be related to be tracked over time."
				StatementTopic is type BodyStructureTopic


EntryElement:	BodyStructureAbsenceStatement  // AssertionOfAbsenceStatement?
Based on:		ConditionAbsenceStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Absence of a distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. Body structures are continuants that allow observations of the same body structure to be related to be tracked over time."
				StatementTopic is type BodyStructureTopic

EntryElement:	DiseaseProgression
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
Description:	"A finding related to the current trend of a particular existing disease. This concept is most often used for chronic and incurable diseases where the status and trendline of the disease is an important determinant of therapy and prognosis. The specific disorder being evaluated must be cited in the Focus_Reference or Focus_CodeableConcept as a reference to a Condition."
				ObservationContext.ResultValue value is type CodeableConcept
				ObservationContext.ResultValue from ProgressionVS
				ObservationTopic.TopicCode is MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
0..*			ProgressionEvidence
//    "ProgressionEvidence" is somewhat related to FindingMethod, which represents the test or procedure used to generate the result; it is typically a LOINC code (0..1)
				ObservationTopic.Focus.CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-problem if covered 
0..0			ObservationTopic.Specimen
0..0			ObservationTopic.EvaluationComponent
0..0			ObservationTopic.Precondition
0..0			ObservationTopic.ReferenceRange  // applies to a quantitative measurement only			

		Element:		ProgressionEvidence
		Description:	"The type of evidence considered in determining disease progression."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ProgressionEvidenceVS
