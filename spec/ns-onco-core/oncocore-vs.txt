ValueSet:    GeneticTestVS
Description: "Value set containing codes representing genetic tests. Currently the best source of codes is the [Genetic Test Registry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr). The user should be aware that the GTR cannot be a sole reliable source since the test data is voluntarily updated and there is no overarching data steward. This value set contains all codes from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-diagnosticreport-lab-codes (namely, the subset of LOINC codes with CLASSTYPE = 1), plus all codes in GTR.

Implementation note: Although only a subset of LOINC codes is formally part of this value set, the value set itself contains all codes in LOINC, because FHIR cannot create an implicitly-defined value set based on LOINC's CLASSTYPE property.

Conformance note: To be conformant to US Core, a LOINC code must be used, if available. Only if there is no suitable code in LOINC may other codes (such as those from GTR) be used."

Description:  "Codes describing the location(s) of primary or secondary cancer. The value set includes all codes from the SNOMED CT body structure hierarchy (codes descending from 123037004 'Body Structure'). The cancer body location may also be expressed using ICD-O-3 topography codes, however, those codes are not included here due to intellectual property restrictions. No other code systems are considered conformant."

ValueSet:   HistologyMorphologyBehaviorVS
Description: "Codes representing the structure, arrangement, and behavioral characteristics of malignant neoplasms, and cancer cells. Inclusion criteria: in situ neoplasms and malignant neoplasms. Exclusion criteria: benign neoplasms and neoplasms of unspecified behavior. Note: As the vocabulary binding is extensible within this IG, ICD-O-3 morphology codes (including behavior suffix) may also be used; they are not included in the value set for intellectual property reasons. For primary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /1, /2, or /3. For secondary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /6. Only SNOMED CT and ICD-O-3 are considered conformant to the specification. However, to be compliant with US Core Profiles, ICD-O-3 may only be used if there is no suitable code in SNOMED CT."

Description: "This value set is intended to contain allowable values for the T category, according to TNM staging rules. SNOMED CT codes or AJCC codes (preferrably, version 8 for current cancers) are allowed, but are not listed here due to AJCC intellectual property restrictions.

* AJCC terminology: examples of T categories include 'cTX', used when the tumor primary tumor cannot be evaluated, 'pT0', denoting there is no evidence of a primary tumor, and 'pTis', referencing carcinoma in situ (with some cancer-specific exceptions). Other T categories refer to increasing size of the primary tumor. Please note allowable T categories may vary between clinical and pathologic classifications.

Description: "This value set is intended to contain allowable values for the N category, according to TNM staging rules. SNOMED CT codes or AJCC codes (preferrably, version 8 for current cancers) are allowed, but are not listed here due to AJCC intellectual property restrictions.

* AJCC terminology: examples of N categories include 'cN0', indicating no evidence of lymph node involvement, and 'pN1', indicating regional lymph node involvement to a small extent, with specific thresholds for the lymph node groups and number of lymph nodes involved. Other N categories refer to increasing lymph node involvement. Please note allowable N categories may vary between clinical and pathologic classifications.
