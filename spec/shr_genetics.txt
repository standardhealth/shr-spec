Element:		GenomicSourceClass
Concept:		LNC#48002-0 "Genomic source class [Type]"
Description:	"The genomic class of the specimen being analyzed: Germline for inherited genome, somatic for cancer genome, and prenatal for fetal genome. (source: LOINC)"
Value:			CodeableConcept from GenomicSourceClassVS	// LOINC preferred answer list for LNC#48002-0.

Element:		GeneName
Concept:		LNC#48018-6 "Gene studied [ID]"
Description:	"HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) identifier for a gene. (source: LOINC)"
Value:			CodeableConcept from http://www.genenames.org if covered
				// interpretation LOINC preferred answer list LL378-1 for LNC#48018-6.

Element:		DNARegionName
Concept:		LNC#47999-8 "DNA region name [Identifier]"
Description:	"A human readable name for the region of interest. Typically Exon #, Intron # or other. NOTE: This is not standardized and is mainly for convenience and display purposes."
Value:			string

Element:		DNASequenceVariantName
Based on:		NonIndependentFinding
Concept:		LNC#48004-6 "DNA change (c.HGVS)"
Description:	"Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature for a single DNA marker. The use of the nomenclature must be extended to describe non-variations (aka. wild types) see samples for wild type examples. (source: LOINC)"
Value:			string

Element:		DNASequenceVariantId
Based on:		NonIndependentFinding
Concept:		LNC#48003-8 "DNA sequence variation identifier [Identifier]"
Description:	"A DNA Marker identifier conveys a universal or standard repository identifier for definitive characterstics of a DNA Marker. (recommend using NCBI dbSNP ids - rs#) (source: LOINC)"
Value:			string

Element:		DNASequenceVariantType
Based on:		CodedNonIndependentFinding
Concept:		LNC#48005-3 "DNA change type"
Description:	"Codified type for associated DNA Marker. DNA Marker's use the HGVS notation which implies the DNA Marker Type, but the concurrent use of this code will allow a standard and explicit type for technical and display convenience."
Value:			CodeableConcept from DNAChangeTypeVS


EntryElement:	TumorMarker
Based on:		CodedLaboratoryObservation
Concept:		LNC#21924-6 "Tumor marker Cancer"
Description:	"A substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms).  Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis."
