		Description:	"The time period between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed.
		CIMI Alignment: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, specimen processing is represented as a 'SpecimenProcessingPerformed' clinical statement, mapped to FHIR Procedure. However, specimen processing should actually map to FHIR Specimen.processing, part of the Specimen resource. It would be a difficult mapping exercise (beyond the scope of this IG) to express the mapping rule that any CIMI SpecimenProcessingPerformed clinical statement needs to mapped to FHIR by (1) finding the corresponding Specimen entity, and (2) mapping the content of (possibly multiple) SpecimenProcessingPerformed into the FHIR Specimen resource. To avoid this complexity, the breast cancer model expresses the cold ischemia time as an attribute of the BreastSpecimen rather than a separate procedure."

Description:	"The Oncotype DX test for invasive breast cancer examines the activity of 21 genes in a patient’s breast tumor tissue to provide personalized information for tailoring treatment based on the biology of their individual disease. The value from 0 to 100 indicates the estimated risk of recurrence, with the highest risk indicated by a score greater than 31.
No LOINC code currently exists for this test. We are seeking feedback on the value of separating OncotypeDx scores for DCIS and invasive breast carcinomas. Does it make more sense to report the OncotypeDx as a single score, regardless of the type of cancer?"

The Ki67 labeling index is the fraction of Ki-67-positive cells to total cells in a tumor specimen and may be useful for determining prognosis with respect to survival and disease recurrence.  The Ki-67 antigen is measured numerically as a percentage, and as an ordinal. The more positive cells there are, the more quickly they are dividing and forming new cells.
