Element:		Locatable 
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Abstract top level class in the hierarchy. Locatable defines the idea of 'locatability in an archetyped structure'.

CIMI Alignment: The Locatable class reflects CIMI's current implementation using Archetype Description Language (ADL). Its attributes (archetype_node_id, name, and archetype_details) are necessary to serialize CIMI definitions in ADL. By all rights, these attributes should be invisible in clinical models. To avoid complicating the breast cancer profiles with extensions irrelevant to the clinical content, the attributes of Locatable have been omitted."

Element:		Content
Based on:		Locatable
Description:	"Abstract ancestor of all concrete content types. A unit of content that makes up a composition - e.g., a clinical statement in a patient record, a simple or composite action is a knowledge document, a catalog entry in a catalog."


Element: 		InformationEntry
Based on:		Content
Concept:		MTH#C1705654
Description:	"An entry in a patient record or in a report, generally used for the documentation of clinical information about a subject of information such as a patient or a relative of the patient, asserted by a particular source, recorded, and potentially verified. 

CIMI Alignment: The CIMI-defined attributes from InformationEntry (identifier, subjectOfInformation, attribution, additionalText, and recordStatus) have been omitted from the current model because of problems mapping between InformationEntry and FHIR DomainResource. Attributes in DomainResource (id, versionId, lastUpdated, profile, security, tag, implicitRules, language, text, contained, extension, modifierExtension) are quite different than those in InformationEntry. Reconciling these differences is outside the scope of the current ballot on breast cancer."


Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		InformationEntry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. 

The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed."
1..1			StatementTopic
1..1			StatementContext
0..1			Encounter

	Element:		Encounter
	Based on:		InformationEntry
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"An abstract class that represents an encounter class. This class has been stubbed out to limit the scope of this implementation guide to classes relevant to this ballot concerning breast cancer."

Element:		CompoundClinicalStatement
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Description:	"A CompoundClinicalStatement is a clinical statement representing a collection of independent clinical statements. 

Each statement within a compound clinical statement may exist outside of the context of the compound clinical statement without any alteration to its meaning. An example is a Panel. Note that complex medications are indivisible clinical statements even though their structure may be a composite data structure. They are generally treated as an independent entry in a record and their parts do not constitute independent entries in a record."
0..*			ref(ClinicalStatement)

Element:		IndivisibleClinicalStatement
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Description:	"Represents clinical statements that cannot be further decomposed into multiple independent clinical statements, i.e., all clinical statements that are not CompoundClinicalStatements. 

An indivisible clinical statement must be able to stand alone, such as a systolic blood pressure measurement, which can be interpreted both inside a blood pressure panel or on its own. If the statement cannot stand alone, e.g., the size of a wound, which cannot exist outside the context of the wound itself, then the Component class should be used instead."
	
	
Element:		StatementTopic
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that make up the clinical focus of a statement. 

StatementTopic class attributes are aligned with SNOMED CT Concept Model attributes when such an overlap exists. Note that this class does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc...), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded).

CIMI Alignment: StatementTopic had an attribute called 'key' in CIMI V0.0.4, but CIMI is renaming it 'TopicCode', as represented here."
1..1			TopicCode

		Element:		TopicCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. 
		
		For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.
		
		CIMI Alignment: TopicCode is the new CIMI name for the attribute formerly called 'key' in CIMI V0.0.4."
		Value:			CodeableConcept


Element:		StatementContext
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that provides the context for the topic of a clinical statement. 

The StatementContext class aligns with the SNOMED CT Situations with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model. The StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information. It also often holds provenance information relevant to the context of the clinical statement. It is important to note that by default the context applies to the conjunction of the attribute specified in the statement. For instance, if a clinical statement has a topic describing a rash on left arm and a context of 'absent', then the statement states that the subject of interest did not have a rash on the left arm but might have had one on the right arm.

CIMI Alignment: ContextCode is the new CIMI name for the attribute formerly called 'type' in CIMI V0.0.4. The attribute 'temporalContext' that appeared in CIMI V0.0.4 is no longer part of CIMI."
1..1			ContextCode

		Element:		ContextCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code representing the ontological status of the statement, e.g., whether it exists, does not exist, is planned, etc. 
		
		Attribute aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model context attributes: 'Finding context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408729009) and 'Procedure context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408730004). The range allowed for this attribute shall be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model specification for SWEC.
		
		CIMI Alignment: ContextCode is the new CIMI name for the attribute formerly called 'type' in CIMI V0.0.4."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		SCT#410514004
Description:	"The FindingContext class provides the context for the EvaluationResultTopic and AssertionTopic in a clinical statement. 

For instance, a statement about findings may state that the finding was observed to be present or absent. This class aligns with the SNOMED Situation with Explicit Context.The base class for representing the ontological status of a finding, e.g., present, absent, goal, risk, expectation, etc.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingContext included a 'status' attribute. However, there are several problems with this. (1) To align with FHIR, the datatype of status should be Concept, not Attribution. (2) In FHIR, different types of status with different shades of meaning are found in different subclasses, for example, clinicalStatus and verificationStatus in Condition, and status in Observation. (3) Status will not be uniform in meaning across all CIMI finding contexts. For example, in GoalContext, the relevant status might be the progress toward the goal, which does not have the same meaning as the status of an EvaluationResult."

Element:		EvaluationResultContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with EvaluationResultTopic and its subclasses.

CIMI Alignment: This class was recently added to CIMI (after V0.0.4)"

Element:		AssertionContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with AssertionTopic and its subclasses.

CIMI Alignment: This class was recently added to CIMI (after V0.0.4)."


	Element:		PresenceContext
	Based on:		AssertionContext
	Concept:		SCT#410515003
	Description:	"PresenceContext indicates that the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. 
	
	For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present.
	
	CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, there were two classes, KnownOrSuspectedPresent and AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. CIMI has recently decided to combine these classes and rename it PresenceContext, as represented here."

			CIMI Alignment: This attribute corresponds to FindingContext.status, but has been defined to align with FHIR."
			Value:		CodeableConcept			
	
	
			Element:	Certainty
			Concept:	TBD
			Description:	"The degree of confidence in a conclusion or assertion.
			
			CIMI Alignment: This attribute aligns with KnownOrSuspectedPresent.certainty in CIMI V0.0.4, but with the recent realignment of CIMI classes, this attribute is attached to the correct class, PresenceContext."
			Value:		CodeableConcept
	
	Element:		RecordedContext
	Based on:		EvaluationResultContext
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"Context for an evaluation result, used to indicate an evaluation has been made. 
	
	For example, measurement of blood pressure that has been made simply exists (although the value can be present or absent, accurate or inaccurate). The RecordedContext indicates the information presented stands on its own as presented. It can also apply to clinical notes.
	
	CIMI Alignment: The RecordedContext class did not exist in CIMI V0.0.4, but CIMI has recently added it."
					ContextCode is SCT#424975005 "Record Entity" 
	1..1			FindingStatus
	0..1			ExceptionValue
	0..1			RelevantTime   // ClinicallyRelevantTime isn't a good name when it comes to employment and other life history events

		Element:		FindingStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Indicates whether the finding is preliminary, amended, final, etc..
		
		CIMI Alignment: This class corresponds to FindingContext.status, but has been aligned to FHIR. The value set binding is required by FHIR."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status
	
		Element:		ExceptionValue
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Reason that a value associated with a test or other finding is missing.
		
		CIMI Alignment: This attribute corresponds to EvaluationResultTopic.exceptionValue, but has been moved from topic to context because missing values are only relevant when they should be recorded, but are not. The value set binding extends the set of FHIR's required data absent values, with additional concepts from CIMI."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ExceptionValueVS
	
		Element:		RelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses.
		
		The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium).
		
		CIMI Alignment: This attribute has been added, since recorded values must have an associated time. The datatype has been chosen to align with FHIR."
		Value:			dateTime or TimePeriod 

		
Element: 		FindingTopic
Based on:		StatementTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Base class - independent of context - for all kinds of determinations: questions/answers, conditions, observations, allergies, and other findings. 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingTopic has four attributes: result, description, multimedia, and intepretation. Here, result is represented by EvaluationResultTopic.Value and AssertionTopic.Value. Description and Multimedia have been omitted for brevity."
0..1			FindingMethod
0..1			Interpretation
		
		Element:		Interpretation
		Concept:		MTH#C0420833
		Description:	"A clinical interpretation of a finding.
		
		CIMI Alignment: The value set binding has been chosen to align with FHIR. (Note: it is not clear if Interpretation belongs in FindingTopic, rather than a context class, but that is how CIMI has modeled it.)"
		Value:			CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-interpretation if covered

		Element:		FindingMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The technique used to create the finding; for example, the specific imaging technique, lab test code, or assessment vehicle.
		
		CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, this attribute was called 'method'. The value set binding reflects CIMI's preference for LOINC codes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept should be from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-codes
//
Abstract Element: AssertionTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base topic for conditions, allergies, adverse events, etc. These are things that are asserted to exist or not. The Value is interpreted in the context of the class; for an AdverseSensitivityToSubstance, the value is the substance; for a ConditionPresenceStatement, the Value represents the type of condition found.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus more properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there."
Value:			0..1  CodeableConcept

		
Element:		EvaluationResultTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"The base class, independent of context, for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

CIMI Alignment:
1) In CIMI  V0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, where specimen is 0..1. The cardinality of Specimen has been changed to 0..1 to enable FHIR mapping.
2) In CIMI V0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model. CompoundClinicalStatement has not been used to represent panel-like findings, because of the complexity of mapping this class to FHIR.
3) In CIMI V0.0.4, allowable datatypes for result (aka Value) include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to only the allowable FHIR datatypes.
4) ExceptionValue has been moved to the RecordedContext, because it is only relevant when a value is supposed to be recorded, but is not.
5) The cardinality of FindingMethod has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.method is 0..1.
6) The class PhysicalEvaluationResult has been united with this class, and the body location (AnatomicalLocation) has been added to this class. This is because bodySite is part of Observation, and it cannot be profiled out of EvaluationResult and then re-included in PhysicalEvaluationResult.
7) The cardinality of AnatomicalLocation has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.bodySite is 0..1.
8) The attribute evaluationDate has been moved to RecordedContext, because it only applies to evaluations that have been done.
9) The attributes device and evaluationProcedure have been removed for brevity, since they are not used in the current IG."

The value set binding of Value is required to map to US-Core. The value set binding of Category is preferred in US-Core.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called ConditionAssertion, but CIMI has recently changed it to ConditionTopic.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The corresponding CIMI class is ungoing a name change to include the word 'StatementContext' and remove the word 'Assertion'. The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR clinicalStatus, severity, and criticality) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings."
