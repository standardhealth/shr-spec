/* DISCUSSION: Options and pros/cons for modeling progression/disease status:

1) We are recording the status of a disease, i.e., the disease status, so the first and most obvious option is to use Condition.clinicalStatus. However, in FHIR, the required value set don't have the necessary terms (no 'responding' 'stable' or 'progressing'), and that can't be changed. In addition, there would be no place to record the evidence for the status change. Lastly, it would be inconvenient to go through past versions of the Condition resource to determine the history and timing of status changes. So not promising.

2) Assessment of disease progression seems to fit ClinicalImpression (see http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/clinicalimpression.html). There are fields for the type of impression (ClinicalImpression.code), the finding itself as a code (finding.itemCodeableConcept), and for maintaining history, a link to the previous clinical impression. One could probably record the evidence for the conclusion in investigation.code, and the problem evaluated in ClinicalImpression.problem (type ref(Condition)). There is also a potentially useful field for action taken, such as adjustment of medication (however, only references to other resources are allowed; to use codes would require an extension). It is unclear where to put information on the lesions evaluated (no specific lesion, target lesions, primary lesion, metastatic lesions). However, even if ClinicalImpression is the best choice, this is not a "mainstream" FHIR resource, it has low maturity (level 0), and is not supported by Argonaut (and probably no one else). 

3) Back to the old standby, Observation. Observation can refer to the cancer condition via the focus attribution. There are several questions:

a) What is the right observation code? It could be LNC#88040-1 "Response to cancer treatment" but an evaluation of disease status could come after a period of non-treatment, for example, to check for recurrence after a period of remission. It could be SCT#246453008 "Course of illness (attribute)", which is more general. I think it can be argued that even if there is no treatment directly before the evaluation, we are still evaluating the response to treatment, specifically, whether the treatment effect persisted. The normative LOINC code answer list LL4721-8 is exactly what we need:
   	1        	Complete response    	LA28366-5	 
 	2    	 	Partial response    	LA28369-9	 
 	3    	 	Stable disease    	 	LA28371-5	 
 	4    	 	Progressive disease    	LA28370-7	 
 	5    	 	Not assessed    	 	LA9348-9
So, it is best to go with LOINC, using SNOMED equivalents for the answers (?).

b) Where to put the type of evidence used in the evaluation? (e.g., imaging, histopathology, symptoms, physical evalution, biomarkers) 
It appears that Observation.derivedFrom is the closest match, it is designed to refer to other observations, not a general TYPE of evidence. It doesn't allow coded values. So, it looks like an extension is required.

c) How to represent the lesion evaluated? (not necessary in mCODE, but required for Brain Mets study.)
i. Instead of the cancer condition, the focus (Observation.focus) could be a reference to the lesion(s) evaluated. Downside is that this would require a separate Condition or BodyStructure resource for parts of the cancer, e.g., primary tumor, metastatic tumors, and or target lesions. 
ii. The lesion(s) examined could be pre-coordinated in the observation code, for example, status of metastates, status of overall disease, status of target lesions. The upside is that these ARE different observations, and that difference would be reflected in the Observation.code. The downside is these codes don't exist, and creating more precoordinated codes is generally undesirable, unscalable solution.
iii. BodyLocation could be used. However, Observation.bodySite should be a body site, not a notation like "primary tumor" or "metastatic tumors".
iv. Create an extension for recording which lesion(s) were evaluated. That's always a last resort; an addition downside is that suitable codes do not exist. Still, this is probably the least bad of the proposed solutions.

/* Discussion: How to capture date and site of first metastases.
Could be modeled with condition, observation, or clinical impression.

1) Condition - has advantage of having an onset date (thus indicating the date of first metastasis) and (0..*) body site. Using Condition suggests the distant metastases are a separate condition from the "main cancer". This could be useful in describing disease progression for just the mets (see above). The Condition could be updated if/when the cancer invades other body sites. Has the disadvantage of not having a place for the number of mets, and condition does not have a way to indicate a condition is part of another condition. Both of these can be addressed through extensions.

2) Observation - has the advantage of having components that can cover a variety of additional details, such as number of mets. However, each body site must be treated separately, since body site is 0..1 in Observation. It has the advantage of being able to record separate observations at multiple times, which is more clear than tracking history of a Condition through versioning (perhaps). 

Conclusion: Having a place for the onset date of mets, which is an mCODE requirement, is a +1 for Condition...so is the ability to give multiple body sites. Use of Condition to describe a part of another condition is consistent with the philosophy used for wounds, where each wound is a separate condition, each wound tunnel on the wound is a (sub)condition, the length of the tunnel is an observation on the wound tunnel. Another advantage is that using condition provides a natural way to track the progression of the mets, separate from the progression of the entire disease (see discussion on DiseaseStatus).
