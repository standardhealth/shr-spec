Abstract:          Resource
Description:       "Parent class for any item in clinical or administrative health-related system. Contains metadata attributes that apply to any item represented in the standard health record. An DomainResource can belong to a single person's health record, or represent an entity that surfaces in multiple records, such as organizations, providers, payments, decision support artifacts, etc."

Abstract:          DomainResource
Parent:            Resource
Description:       "Parent class for any item in clinical or administrative health-related system. A DomainResource can belong to a single person's health record, or represent an entity that surfaces in multiple records, such as organizations, providers, payments, decision support artifacts, etc.

Note to FHIR implementers: Objective FHIR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an 'active' flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, Objective FHIR uses status across all domain resources."

Element:           Status
Description:       "A state that relates to the workflow or interpretation of this resource. Certain status values can modify the meaning of the resource, for example, entered-in-error. When a boolean value is used, Status of true indicates the record is active, false means inactive."
                   // should be from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/resource-status
Value:             concept

Abstract:          InformationItem
Parent:            DomainResource
Description:       "An abstract class representing items such as administrative records, knowledge artifacts, definitional items, and entities such as organizations and entities. These items are often independent of a single patient, and do not represent clinical judgements or observations about a patient."


Abstract:          ClinicalStatement
Parent:            DomainResource
Description:       "This abstract class provides properties and behaviors common to entries in a medical record. Patient and Encounter are ubiquitous in clinical statements. This class also allows for common representation of simple data provenance elements asserter, recorder, and creation date."
Property:          SubjectOfRecord 0..1
Property:          CareContext 0..1
Property:          StatementDateTime 0..1  // often called 'authoredOn'
// The following fields should be part of ClinicalStatement, but supporting them is not possible until we have the capability to override choices with choices. This is complicated by the fact that we need to generate an extension when the resource we're mapping to lacks a corresponding field. Then the extension's value cannot be constrained (a new extension would be required). Fundamentally, the 'substitute' constraint only works when there is an existing attribute in the resource to map to.           
        //0..1			Author
        //0..1			InformationSource
        //0..1			FocalSubject
        //0..1			RecordedBy
        //0..1			Attestation

Element:           SubjectOfRecord
Description:       "The subject of a clinical statement, often called the Patient or the Subject. The SubjectOfRecord typically identifies the clinical record in which this statement is contained. If the statement should be in John Doe's patient record, then John Doe is the subject of record. When there is no patient, the SubjectOfRecord can also be a location, group, or other entity that statement pertains to. For example, observations concerning a hospital ward would have a Location as the SubjectOfRecord.

Note that the word 'Subject' is used here in the sense of a person or entity subjected to observations or actions, not subject as in a conceptual topic, like heart disease."
Value:             Patient or Practitioner or Group or Device or Specimen or Location or Medication or ResearchSubject

Element:           FocalSubject
Description:       "The person or entity that the information in this resource relates to, if different than the person of record. The subject of information can be a reference or a code, the latter when the subject is described generically, for example, in terms of a relationship to the subject of record (e.g., wife)."
//The entity this condition or observation relates to, for example, a person related to the SubjectOfRecord. The FocalSubject is only required if the person or thing observed is different than the SubjectOfRecord. FocalSubject should not be an anatomical location.  Examples: The focus for cancer progression would be the cancer condition; for wound length, an instance of a wound (a condition). In the case where the FocalSubject is a related person, the value may be a RelatedPerson resource or a concept code with the relationship to the SubjectOfRecord (e.g., wife).
