Entry:             AdverseDrugReaction
Parent:            AdverseEvent
Description:       "A noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product. To be considered an ADR, a causal relationship must be at least suspected by the medical practitioner. The principal difference between an adverse drug reaction (ADR) an adverse event (AE) and is that a causal relationship is suspected for the ADR, but is not required for the AE. Adverse drug reactions are therefore a subset of adverse event reports."
