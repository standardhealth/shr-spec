Description:       "A finding related to the presence of an individual's risk or sensitivity to a substance or class of substances. Per US Core specification, the result includes SNOMED codes representing 'No known allergy'. In AllergyIntolerance, the reactions are included in-line, rather than referencing to conditions (in contrast to AdverseEvent)."

Element:           SubstanceCode
Description:       "The substance triggering a particular allergy or intolerance reaction event. The substance may be the same as the substance cited in the AllergyIntolerance, but should be a specific substance rather than a class of substances, if known. For example, if the allergy intolerance DataValue substance is 'shellfish' the substance code for the reaction might be 'oyster'."
