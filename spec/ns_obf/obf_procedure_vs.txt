ValueSet:		TreatmentIntentVS
Description:	"The purpose of a treatment. The value set includes 'curative' and 'palliative'. Curative is defined as any treatment meant to reduce or control a disease process, even if a 'cure' is not anticipated. Palliative includes treatments meant to reduce symptoms and side effects, such as antiemetics."
SCT#373808002   "Curative - procedure intent"
SCT#363676003   "Palliative - procedure intent"

ValueSet:       SurgicalProcedureVS
Description:    "Codes describing surgical procedures. Includes codes from SNOMED CT under the hierarchy of 387713003 'Surgical procedure'. Codes from ICD-10-PCS and CPT are acceptable. CPT codes are not listed here due to intellectual property restrictions. ICD-10-PCS codes are not listed because of a limitation in the FHIR Implementation Guide publisher. For CPT and ICD-10-PCS, only codes representing surgical procedures should be included. 

Conformance note: If an ICD-10-PCS code is used, and a semantically equivalent SNOMED CT or CPT code is available, the resulting Procedure instance will not be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html)."
Includes codes descending from SCT#387713003 "Surgical procedure (procedure)"

ValueSet:       SurgicalBodyLocationRoleVS
Description:    "Roles of body site in surgical procedures. Value set includes codes from the SNOMED hierarchy descending from 363704007 'Procedure site' and descending from 272737002 'Site of (attribute)'."
Includes codes descending from SCT#363704007 "Procedure site"
Includes codes descending from SCT#272737002 "Site of (attribute)"

SCT#410611000   "Recipient site (body structure)"

ValueSet:       SurgicalMethodVS
Description:    "Codes describing additional information about the method of the surgery. Includes the technique used to reach the site of the procedure, and actions taken during the surgery. Value set includes SNOMED codes descending from 103379005 'Procedural approach' and descending from 129284003 'Surgical action'."
Includes codes descending from SCT#103379005 "Procedural approach"
Includes codes descending from SCT#129284003 "Surgical action"

ValueSet:       DiagnosticImagingVS
Description:    "Codes describing imaging procedures. Value set includes SNOMED codes descending from 363679005 'Imaging (procedure)'."
Includes codes descending from SCT#363679005 "Imaging (procedure)"

ValueSet:       RadiationProcedureVS
Description:    "Codes describing radiation therapy procedures. The value set includes a limited set of radiation modality codes from SNOMED CT, however, ICD-10-PCS code from Section D (Radiation Therapy) and appropriate CPT radiation procedure codes are also considered compliant. CPT codes are not explicitly included due to licensing restrictions. ICD-10-PCS codes are not included explicitly because they are not currently supported by the FHIR IG Publishing tool.

Conformance note: If an ICD-10-PCS code is used, and a semantically equivalent SNOMED CT or CPT code is available, the resulting Procedure instance will not be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html)."
