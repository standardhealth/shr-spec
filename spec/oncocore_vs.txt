Description:    "Types of malignant neoplastic disease. Includes SNOMED CT disorder hierarchy codes for malignant neoplastic disease, as well as ICD-10-CM codes for malignant neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior. Both SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM can precoordinate the cancer location and the histologic type, which will result in some overlap between Cancer Condition and Cancer Histologic Type. For ICD-10-CM in particular, if the histology is known it must be coded."
Includes codes descending from SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"
