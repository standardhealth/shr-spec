ValueSet:       PrimaryOrUncertainBehaviorCancerDisorderVS
Description:    "Types of primary malignant neoplastic disease, coded in  in SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM. 

Conformance note: To be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html), ICD-10-CM should only be used if a suitable code is not available from SNOMED.

For SNOMED CT coding, use a code from the disorder hierarchy under SNOMED CT 363346000 'Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)' excluding codes descending from SNOMED CT 128462008 'Secondary malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)'. If body location is not precoordinated (i.e., implied by the code), the site of the primary tumor should be specified in the body site attribute. 

For ICD-10-CM coding, use one of the codes given in this value set representing primary malignant neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior.

Note that ICD-O-3 specifies morphology and topography, not disorder. If ICD-O-3 is used, the primary cancer disorder code must be specifically be SNOMED CT 363346000  'Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)'. The ICD-O-3 morphology and topography codes should be entered in the HistologyMorphologyBehavior and body location fields, respectively."

SCT#363346000  "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"
Includes codes descending from SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)" and not descending from SCT#128462008  "Secondary malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"

ValueSet:   SecondaryCancerDisorderVS
Description:  "Types of secondary malignant neoplastic disease, coded in SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM. 

Conformance note: To be compliant with [US Core Profiles](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3/index.html), SNOMED CT must be used unless there is no suitable code, in which case ICD-10-CM can be used.

* SNOMED CT coding: Use a code from the disorder hierarchy under secondary malignant neoplastic disease (SNOMED CT 128462008).
* ICD-10-CM coding: Use one of the codes given in this value set representing secondary malignant neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unspecified behavior. If body site is not precoordinated (implied by the code), it should be specified separately using the body location.

Note that ICD-O-3 specifies morphology and topography, not disorder; in this case that the disorder code must be SNOMED CT 128462008 (Secondary malignant neoplastic disease). The ICD-O-3 morphology and topography codes should be entered in the HistologyMorphologyBehavior and bodySite fields, respectively."
