Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.statement
Description:	"The namespace containing cimi-derived classes representing complete clinical statements. In this specification, these classes derive from the StatementTopic class hierarchy, not ClinicalStatement, which is a significant departure from CIMI. This simplifies the resulting logical models."
Uses:			shr.core, cimi.core, cimi.element, cimi.topic, cimi.context, cimi.entity

Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		InformationEntry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. 
The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed."

EntryElement:	Observation   // TODO: be consistent, or stop using the word "Statement" in class names 
Based on:		FindingStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Represents the result of evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) that have been performed.
Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an ExceptionValue indicating why the value is not present. The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments."
