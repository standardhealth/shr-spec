Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.statement
Description:	"The namespace containing cimi-derived classes representing complete clinical statements. In this specification, these classes derive from the StatementTopic class hierarchy, not ClinicalStatement, which is a significant departure from CIMI. This simplifies the resulting logical models."
Uses:			shr.core, cimi.core, cimi.element, cimi.topic, cimi.context, cimi.entity

Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		InformationEntry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. 
The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed."

Element:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Represents the result of evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) that have been performed.
EvaluationResultRecorded has a value representing the result (answer), or an ExceptionValue indicating why the value is not present. The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments."
				StatementTopic is type EvaluationResultTopic
				StatementContext is type EvaluationResultRecordedContext

Element:		LaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Based on:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Description:	"Measurement resulting from a laboratory analysis. The category is fixed to 'laboratory' to align with US-Core."
0..*			DiagnosticService
				EvaluationResultTopic.Category is OBSCAT#laboratory

		Element:		DiagnosticService
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from DiagnosticServiceVS if covered

		
Element:		SimplifiedLaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Based on:		LaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Description:	"The usual case for a test result from a pathology lab, based on a specimen taken from a patient. Note that the body site is not explicit here; it is part of the specimen resource associated with the lab result."

EntryElement:	ConditionPresenceStatement
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A condition that is or may be present in a subject. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly and could be a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble.

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource."
				StatementTopic is type ConditionTopic
				StatementContext is type ConditionPresenceContext
				SubjectOfInformation value is type ref(Patient)

EntryElement:	ConditionAbsenceStatement
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		MTH#C0277541  "no disease present"
Description:	"A finding that a condition is or was not present in the subject at a certain time, not necessarily the time the information is gathered."
				StatementTopic is type ConditionTopic
				StatementContext is type AbsenceContext
				
EntryElement:	ClinicalNote
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		MTH#C0747978 "Progress Note"
Description:	"An entry concerning a patient where the result is a narrative text. Can be related to a specific Focus, such as a condition; and evidence and interpretation from FindingTopic."
				StatementTopic is type FindingTopic
				StatementContext is type RecordedContext
