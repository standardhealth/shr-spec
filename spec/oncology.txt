		Element:	 	ColdIschemiaTime
		Concept:		LNC#44778-9 
		Description:	"The time period between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		
		CIMI Alignment: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, specimen processing is represented as a 'SpecimenProcessingPerformed' clinical statement, mapped to FHIR Procedure. However, specimen processing should actually map to Specimen.processing, part of the Specimen resource. It would be a difficult mapping exercise (beyond the scope of this IG) to express the mapping rule that any CIMI SpecimenProcessingPerformed clinical statement needs to mapped to FHIR by (1) finding the corresponding Specimen entity, and (2) mapping the content of (possibly multiple) SpecimenProcessingPerformed into the FHIR Specimen resource. To avoid this complexity, the breast cancer model expresses the cold ischemia time as an attribute of the BreastSpecimen rather than a separate procedure."

EntryElement:	BreastCancerPresenceStatement
Concept:		SCT#126926005 "Neoplasm of breast (disorder)"
Based on:		ConditionPresenceStatement
Description:	"Diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype.

CIMI Alignment (and question for reviewers): The Topic of this statement is 'Neoplasm of the breast', not 'Assertion', with the logic that the topic of the statement is more specific than 'Assertion'.  The result (the value) gives the particular type (histologic type) of the condition. Does this make sense?"

We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.
