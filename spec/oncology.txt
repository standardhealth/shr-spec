		Element:	 	ColdIschemiaTime
		Concept:		LNC#44778-9 
		Description:	"The time period between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		
		CIMI Alignment: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, specimen processing is represented as a 'SpecimenProcessingPerformed' clinical statement, mapped to FHIR Procedure. However, specimen processing should actually map to Specimen.processing, part of the Specimen resource. It would be a difficult mapping exercise (beyond the scope of this IG) to express the mapping rule that any CIMI SpecimenProcessingPerformed clinical statement needs to mapped to FHIR by (1) finding the corresponding Specimen entity, and (2) mapping the content of (possibly multiple) SpecimenProcessingPerformed into the FHIR Specimen resource. To avoid this complexity, the breast cancer model expresses the cold ischemia time as an attribute of the BreastSpecimen rather than a separate procedure."

EntryElement:	BreastCancerPresenceStatement
Concept:		SCT#126926005 "Neoplasm of the breast"
Based on:		ConditionPresenceStatement
Description:	"FindingTopic or diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype."

The interpretation of positive or negative (found in the interpretation property) is based on the staining percentage, and may take into account the staining intensity. 

Based on discussion with Cancer Interoperability Group subject matter experts, there was insufficient rationale to include the following components in the data model: StainingControl, PrimaryAntibody, Allred Score (both total and component scores). We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

We are seeking feedback if it is better to put the positive/negative status in Value or Interpretation. The current approach is that positive/negative designation is a value, even though that value is (in fact) an interpretation of evidence (NuclearPositivity and AverageStainingIntensity)."
