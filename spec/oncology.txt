		Element:	 	ColdIschemicTime
		Description:	"The time between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced."

Based on:		Condition  
Description:	"FindingTopic or diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The following steps are required to create this class in CIMI:

1) Update the CIMI Reference Model, adding the property MorphologyBehavior to create BreastCancerConditionTopic class.
2) Create an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines the new topic BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext, and introduces constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior.

In this model, the path of least work was to subclass Condition, add the new attribute, and introduce the required constraints, all at once.

The attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included in this class because of the mapping difficulties discussed in Entry."
