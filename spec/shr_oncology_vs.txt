// MK 7/15/2018 -- Weak, strong are qualifier values. Weak staining would be a finding. Is it wrong to use a generic qualifier as a finding? The fact it applies to staining is a type of precoordination (the question is contained in the answer), turning a question-answer into a unary assertion. I view it as equivalent to a numerical answer -- a number cannot contain the question.
