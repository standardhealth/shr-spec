Abstract Element:	ObservationComponent
Description:		"A sub-observation contributing to the parent observation, expressed as separate code value pairs that share the same attributes. Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations. Component observations share the same attributes in the Observation resource as the primary observation and are always treated a part of a single observation (they are not separable). However, the reference range for the primary observation value is not inherited by the component values and is required when appropriate for each component observation."
// should an observation component have additional properties, such as protocol, circumstance, or interpretation?
// how do we handle a normal? (physical exam normal)
// exclusions? (diabetes excluded)

EntryElement:	Observation
Based on:		SituationStatement
Description:	"Represents the result of evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) that have been performed.
Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an DataAbsentReason indicating why the value is not present. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.
For an Observation, the Code describes the aspect or property of the subject being observed or measured. The Code is the 'question code' that pairs to the 'answer' contained in the Value."
