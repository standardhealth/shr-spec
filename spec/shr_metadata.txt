/*------------------------ Metadata Associated with Each Entry ----------------------

  Metadata is information concerning the entry itself -- it does not delve into the content of the entry
  It covers when and by whom the entry was created, updated, the recorder, and the source of information
  Actors can comment on the entry using the log feature
  
  Each entry is comprised of:
		1) Entry metadata: when and by whom the entry was created, updated,etc.
		2) Entry data: specific data related to the entry
  
  In the future, the metadata might extend to:
		l) information about the access, sensitivity, and permissions (consent to share) associated with the entry
		2) information about the quality and certainty of the information in the entryAction
