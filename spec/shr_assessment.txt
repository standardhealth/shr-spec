EntryElement:   KarnofskyPerformanceStatus
Based on:       SimpleNonLaboratoryObservation
Description:	"The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) is a tool used to measure a patient's functional status. It can be used to compare the effectiveness of different therapies and to help assess the prognosis of certain patients, such as those with certain cancers. The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores are associated with better functional status, with 100 representing no symptoms or evidence of disease, and 0 representing death [PMID: 23870327] . This panel contains LOINC terms to report the KPS score [LOINC: 89243-0] and its interpretation [LOINC: 89245-5]."
