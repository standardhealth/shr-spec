<h2><a name="Guidance"></a>Guidance for HL7 Voters</h2>
<p>This section provides orientation to the ballot materials.</p>
<h3>Where to Focus</h3>
<p>There are several representations of the same content in the ballot materials. Different representations will be useful to different audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinicians and cancer domain experts</strong> should primarily focus on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/logical.html">logical models</a>. These models are the simplest representation of the content included in the ballot. <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/valuesets.html">Value sets</a> will also be of interest.</li>
<li><strong>The FHIR community and FHIR implementers</strong> should primarily focus on <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/profiles.html">FHIR Profiles</a>&nbsp;and related matter (extensions, value sets, etc).</li>
<li><strong>The CIMI community</strong> should focus primarily on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/modeldoc/index.html">reference model</a> that shows how the oncology model derives from the CIMI Reference Model, the FHIR mappings, and the resultant <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/logical.html">logical models</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/profiles.html">FHIR Profiles</a>. See <a href="#CIMI">Relationship to CIMI</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions for Commenters</h3>
<p>The sponsoring work groups and the Cancer Interoperability Group are seeking both general and specific comments regarding this material.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the content dealing with breast cancer staging complete and correct from a clinical point of view?</li>
<li>Are there other initiatives or projects that also deal with cross-cutting data standards for breast cancer that should be taken into account?</li>
<li>Is the way the ballot material is presented suitable and useful? If not, what type of format(s) would be more informative?</li>
<li>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single ballot contains CIMI models, FHIR logical models, and FHIR Profiles, all related to eachother. As such, we are interest in whether the voters find such an approach useful.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Breast Cancer Interoperability FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) contains a subset of logical models for breast cancer focused on data elements used for breast cancer staging. FHIR profiles are provided as an example physical representation of the logical models. This IG also serves as a pilot for the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI).</p>
<p><em>Say more about ASCO project?</em></p>
<h2><a name="Background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>Several oncology data models exist today. They were created by specialized communities and for specific purposes like generating synoptic reports for pathology, developing oncology treatment plans, reporting to cancer registries, and supporting clinical documentation in an oncology EHR. There is no clear agreement among these models, further complicating the seamless exchange of structured and coded data among these disparate systems. And yet, there is general consensus on the need to have a common set of data elements that allows for the seamless exchange of oncology data as one proceeds through the cancer patient journey of care.</p>
<p>The HL7 Cancer Interoperability (CI) Project aims to address this concern with the goal of modeling cancer data in a way that can be used for the diagnosis, treatment, and research of cancer. The project is a collaboration of a diverse multidisciplinary group, involved in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, but also the cancer research and surveillance communities.</p>
<p><em>Landscape survey -- important!</em></p>
<h2><a name="Scope"></a>Scope</h2>
<p>The IG covers oncology-specific data necessary support breast cancer treatment and research, focusing first and foremost on data driving clinical decision-making for medical and surgical oncologists. The first iteration of this guide is focused on breast cancer staging. The data required for staging involves several clinical domains and specialties, including medical oncology, surgical oncology, and anatomic pathology. The <em>American Joint Commission on Cancer 8th Edition Staging Manual</em> (AJCC-8) defines the elements used in staging breast cancer. These include TNM categories as well as other factors that are known to influence the prognosis of breast cancer patients, including: tumor grade, hormone receptor status (progesterone and estrogen), as well as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER 2) status, among others.</p>
<p>Over time, we expect the IG will incrementally evolve to cover a wider range of clinical domains (e.g. radiology, clinical genomics, interventional radiology), and expand its scope to include other key areas for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment (e.g. radiation therapy, chemotherapy), while supporting secondary data use in for clinical research, cancer registry reporting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="CIMI"></a>Relationship to CIMI</h2>
<p>The HL7 Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is co-sponsoring this project. To the extent possible, the breast cancer staging model has been based on the CIMI Reference Model (RM). The last "official" release of the RM was Version 0.0.4, for the January 2018 ballot. The CIMI RM is currently undergoing significant revisions as part of ongoing development and ballot reconciliation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a serious attempt has been made to align to the CIMI RM, it is not possible to say to what extent this model is "CIMI compliant" due to ongoing CIMI changes.&nbsp;Deviations from CIMI RM are called out in the documentation of specific classes.&nbsp;These may be indicators where FHIR and CIMI might have to be more closely aligned. There are several reasons the model presented here deviates from the CIMI RM (Version 0.0.4):</p>
<ol>
<li>Changes to CIMI subsequent to V0.0.4, where those changes are known and have been approved in the CIMI WG.</li>
<li>Definitions in the CIMI RM that directly conflict with FHIR.</li>
<li>Addition of terminology bindings</li>
<li>Areas where the CIMI RM and FHIR are so structurally different that mappings to FHIR are difficult to define.</li>
<li>Errors and/or apparent shortcomings in the CIMI RM.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The CIMI community should also inspect the mappings between the breast cancer model and the FHIR profiles. The mappings are found on selected profile pages, on the Text Summary tab. Mappings are not part of all profiles because mappings can be inherited. For example, the mapping of breast cancer diagnosis is entirely based on the mapping found in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-BreastCancerPresenceStatement.html">ConditionPresenceStatement</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Contents"></a>Implementation Guide Contents</h2>
<p>The IG contains several different elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/logical.html">Logical Models</a>. The objective of logical models is to help gather and interpret requirements from stakeholders, particularly clinicians, but also registries, researchers, and others. The logical models document the requirements without the added complication of alignment with FHIR. The breast cancer logical models use reproducible patterns established by CIMI. Some things to note:
<ul>
<li>The only thing that makes the logical models "FHIR Logical Models" is the use of the StructureDefinition resource as a formal representation. They could just as easily be captured in other formalisms, such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) or Archetype Description Language (ADL).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The logical models are separated into "Primary logical models" and "Supporting logical models". The primary models deal directly with breast cancer domain, while the supporting models deal with sub-elements and higher level (parent) models.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Each logical model appears on a separate page, which looks something like the documentation of a FHIR resource, including attributes, cardinality, datatype, and terminology bindings.</li>
<li>Due to current limitations in the FHIR IG publishing tool, when a property's type is another logical model, that type is displayed as a canonical URL and is not linked to the corresponding logical model page. Future versions of the publishing tool are expected to address this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/profiles.html">FHIR Profiles</a>. With logical models in place, they can be mapped to FHIR resources. This step requires knowledge of FHIR and involves more technical considerations than the logical model step. The result is a set of FHIR profiles: FHIR Resources that have been shaped (constrained and extended) to match the intent of the logical models.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Extensions. Generate the Implementation Guide that has all the FHIR artifacts such as Profiles and the ones generated in the first step (e.g. ValueSets). This step will require better understanding of FHIR &ndash; but at the &lsquo;business&rsquo; level rather than deep technical level so should be well within the capabilities of Business Analysts and motivated clinicians.</li>
